        <section>
            <h1>What is Tau Beta Pi?</h1>

            <p>Tau Beta Pi is the second oldest Engineering honor society. It was founded at Lehigh University in
                1885. There are now collegiate chapters at 251 US colleges and universities, 47 active alumni
                chapters in 16 districts across the country, and a total initiated membership of approximately
                625,275.</p>

            <p>Our purpose is to mark those who have brought honor to their alma mater by distinguished scholarship
                and exemplary character as students and as professionals.</p>

            <p>Tau Beta Pi has four fundamental principles that we abide by and must be seen within
                the character of any potential member. They are as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Using their knowledge and skill for the enhancement of human welfare.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Being honest and impartial, and serving with fidelity the public, their employers, and clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Striving to increase the competence and prestige of the engineering profession.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supporting the professional and technical societies of their disciplines.
                </li>
            </ol>


            <p>These are just a few of the traits that are looked at when deciding on new members. Honor and
                integrity are fundamental and exemplary character is expected of those who join this honor society.
            </p>

            <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>

            <p>As an undergraduate, those whose scholarship places them in the top 1/8 of their second-to-last year
                or in the top 1/5 of their last year are eligible for membership consideration. These students are
                then further considered based on their personal integrity, breadth of interest both inside and
                outside engineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity.</p>

            <p>Graduate students are also eligible for consideration if their scholarship places them in the top 1/5
                of their graduate class, or their high quality work is attested by a faculty member.</p>

            <p>At Youngstown State University we hold two initiation ceremonies a year, one each semester. If you
                are eligible based on your scholarship during either semester of your second-to-last year or final
                year, you will receive an official Tau Beta Pi letter from either a current member or YSU faculty.
            </p>

            <p>Tau Beta Pi has a program known as "Engineering Futures" that is dedicated to providing professional
                skills training to help Tau Beta Pi members succeed in their future careers. There are several
                upcoming skills training webinars that you can attend!</p>
